# Design of a Zonal-UFLS scheme in IEEE 39-bus network


The objective of this project is to implement a Under-Frequency Load Shedding(UFLS)scheme where the whole network wouldbe divided into multiple zones.
IEEE Standard 39-bus system(New England Power System)is the experiment test-bed for the project.The zonal UFLS Scheme showed significant improvement in system RoCoF and frequency nadir.
